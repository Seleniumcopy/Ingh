Here's an updated version incorporating your prior automation experience:

"I joined the Bank in 2018 with prior experience in automation testing, bringing a solid foundation in scripting and test automation tools. From the start, I focused on enhancing the Bank's quality assurance processes by implementing efficient testing frameworks and methodologies. With expertise in tools like Selenium, Postman, and JMeter, I contributed to optimizing test coverage and ensuring seamless delivery of high-quality solutions.

In February 2022, I was promoted to Quality Specialist 2A, a role that allowed me to take on greater responsibilities. Leading QA efforts for critical projects, I worked on streamlining test cycles and integrating CI/CD pipelines, significantly improving deployment timelines and system reliability. One of the highlights of my journey has been delivering high-priority projects with zero post-production defects.

Apart from my technical contributions, I am passionate about mentoring new team members and fostering a culture of continuous learning. By actively participating in knowledge-sharing initiatives, I have been able to help my peers grow while sharpening my interpersonal skills.

Iâ€™m grateful for the opportunities to grow professionally and for the exceptional leadership that fosters innovation and teamwork. My journey at the Bank has been one of leveraging my skills, learning from challenges, and driving impactful results."
