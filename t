Sure! Here's a simpler version:

"I joined the Bank in 2018 with some experience in automation testing, which helped me quickly adapt to my role. From the beginning, I worked on improving the quality of projects by using tools like Selenium, Postman, and JMeter. I focused on creating effective testing processes to ensure reliable and high-quality deliveries.

In February 2022, I was promoted to Quality Specialist 2A, which gave me the chance to take on more responsibilities. I worked on key projects where I led testing efforts, improved workflows, and introduced CI/CD pipelines. One of my proudest achievements was helping deliver projects with no issues after production.

Along the way, I’ve also enjoyed mentoring new team members and sharing knowledge within the team. This has helped me grow my skills while supporting others in their development.

I’m thankful for the opportunities I’ve had here and the support of great leadership. My journey at the Bank has been all about learning, teamwork, and contributing to meaningful results."
