Self-Review for the Year

Over the course of the year, I have successfully delivered on several critical initiatives and made significant contributions to multiple projects. Below are the key highlights of my achievements:

1. Delivery of Mexico Alerts API and KYC Digital API:

Successfully delivered two critical APIs.

Coordinated effectively with the Alerts Team and Swift team to test the APIs.

Developed in-sprint automation for these delivered APIs, which was further utilized in the regression phase.

The automated test cases streamlined our testing process, ensuring consistency and efficiency.

Running the same automation suite in production significantly reduced validation efforts for both the PO and QA teams.



2. ACH SIA OOS Validation:

Worked on validating ACH SIA Out-of-Sync (OOS) records.

Tested queries to identify OOS records in the LLE system, contributing to improved accuracy and reporting.



3. Production Release Support:

Played an instrumental role in ensuring smooth production releases by executing both automated and manual test executions.

Contributed to timely and high-quality delivery of products by identifying and resolving potential issues proactively.



4. Major Release and APS Connect:

Assisted in pre-OTA efforts for major releases across various teams.

Involved in APS Connect to bring PKE closures to completion by following up on critical items, ensuring no delays.



5. 2FA Automation and Implementation:

Initiated and worked on 2FA automation for enabling 2FA during login for key applications like ITP and SC.

Actively contributed to 2FA changes for the Service Center app, which was a critical release.

Identified and resolved several bugs during testing, ensuring release timelines were met by working during multiple weekends and overcoming challenges.



6. Prospect Company Setup:

Contributed to the Prospect Company Setup, a critical use case similar to KYC Digital.

Ensured seamless implementation and smooth delivery.
