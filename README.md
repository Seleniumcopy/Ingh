0:00–0:30 ■ Opening & Context

“Good morning/afternoon.

I’m [Your Name], and today I’ll share how I leverage ChatGPT as a practical “pair programmer” and “on-demand mentor” in my daily work.”

Why this matters:

Reduces context-switching

Answers or code snippets in seconds

Frees me up for higher-value tasks

0:30–2:00 ■ Three Key Work Scenarios

1. Test Automation & JSON Validation (≈40 s)

Problem: I needed to verify complex JSON payloads in automated test suites.

ChatGPT’s help:

Walked me through writing a validateJsonNodeContains method that handles both object fields and array indices.

Provided example Java code snippets for BDD step definitions that hit an API, assert status 200, and extract nested values.


Outcome:

Cut development time by ~50% on that story.

Fewer bugs in CI pipelines—tests catch issues earlier.



2. Custom Dashboards in Octane & Bruno (≈40 s)

Problem: Stakeholders wanted widget-style reports of test runs: pass vs. pending statuses, per-suite breakdown.

ChatGPT’s help:

Crafted Splunk-style filters and bar-chart definitions to visualize each suite’s status.

Automated OAuth2 token fetch in Bruno using bru.runRequest(), so my scripts never fail on expired tokens.


Outcome:

Real-time dashboards with accurate metrics.

No more manual token refresh headaches.



3. Git Workflow Rescue (≈30 s)

Problem: Stuck on an urgent hotfix—had uncommitted changes and a failing push.

ChatGPT’s help:

Suggested a stash + reset + cherry-pick approach that preserved my work and aligned with the team branch.


Outcome:

Hotfix merged within minutes.

Avoided a lengthy rebase or merge conflict marathon.

2:00–3:30 ■ Two Bonus Use-Cases

4. Multilingual Reporting (≈40 s)

Problem: Needed a concise technical summary in Tamil for local stakeholders, plus an English PDF.

ChatGPT’s help:

Translated technical insights, adapting terminology for clarity in both languages.

Formatted the English version as a ready-to-share PDF outline.


Outcome:

Stakeholder satisfaction improved.

Zero back-and-forth on wording.



5. Career & Skill Planning (≈30 s)

Problem: I wanted to chart out next certifications and languages for a shift into backend services.

ChatGPT’s help:

Compared ISTQB vs. other QA certs.

Recommended Rust fundamentals and microservices principles for my roadmap.


Outcome:

Clear 6-month learning plan.

Confidence to discuss career path in performance reviews.




---

3:30–4:30 ■ Impact & Metrics

Time saved:

Average ~15 minutes per task, multiplied across ~10 tasks/week = ~2.5 hours saved weekly.


Error reduction:

Automated JSON validations caught 80% of data-format bugs before code review.


Engagement:

Team started “office hours with ChatGPT” demos after seeing my demos.


Soft benefits:

Boosted my confidence tackling unfamiliar libraries or languages.

Elevated my “go-to” value on the team.




---

4:30–5:00 ■ Wrap-Up & Call to Action

“In summary,”

ChatGPT is more than just “another search engine.”

It’s a flexible collaborator—code, translate, troubleshoot, plan.


Your next steps:

1. Identify one repetitive task you do this week.


2. Ask ChatGPT for a template or snippet.


3. Measure time savings & share it with your team.



“Thank you—happy to take questions.”
